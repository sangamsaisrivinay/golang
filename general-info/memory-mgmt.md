Here's a detailed explanation of **memory management in Go**, the **difference between `new` and `make`**, and a generated **README file** you can use in your project.

## üß† Memory Management in Go

Memory management in Go (Golang) is primarily handled automatically by the **garbage collector (GC)**. Go‚Äôs memory model is designed for simplicity and efficiency, especially for concurrent applications. Key points include:

* **Garbage Collection**: Go uses a concurrent garbage collector that automatically frees memory that is no longer reachable.
* **Heap vs Stack**:

  * **Stack**: Function-local variables are often allocated on the stack.
  * **Heap**: Variables that escape function scope (like returned pointers) are allocated on the heap.
* **Escape Analysis**: The compiler decides whether a variable goes on the stack or heap based on its usage.
* **Manual Allocation Not Required**: Unlike C/C++, developers do not need to manually allocate or free memory.

## üîç Difference Between `new` and `make` in Go

| Feature        | `new`                     | `make`                               |
| -------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Purpose        | Allocates memory          | Initializes built-in reference types |
| Return Value   | Pointer to zeroed storage | Initialized value (not a pointer)    |
| Used For       | Any type                  | Slices, maps, channels               |
| Initialization | Zero value only           | Full initialization                  |
| Example        | `ptr := new(int)`         | `slice := make([]int, 10)`           |

### `new` Example:

```go
x := new(int) // x is of type *int, points to zero value of int (0)
*x = 42
```

### `make` Example:

```go
s := make([]int, 5, 10) // Creates slice with len=5, cap=10
m := make(map[string]int)
c := make(chan int, 2)
```

# Go Memory Management & Keywords (`new` vs `make`)

## Overview

This project demonstrates how memory management works in Go and explains the difference between the `new` and `make` keywords, both used for memory allocation but in different contexts.

## üß† Memory Management in Go

Go handles memory allocation and deallocation through an automatic garbage collector. Key points include:

- Automatic garbage collection.
- Stack vs heap allocation determined by escape analysis.
- No manual `free()` required.

## üîç `new` vs `make`

| Feature         | `new`                                | `make`                                          |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Purpose         | Allocates memory                      | Initializes built-in reference types            |

### Examples

```go
x := new(int) // Allocates memory, returns *int
*x = 10       // Sets value

s := make([]int, 5, 10) // Creates slice with len=5, cap=10
m := make(map[string]int)
c := make(chan int, 2)
