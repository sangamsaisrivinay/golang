# 🔧 Go Build Process Summary

This document provides a concise guide to building Go programs, including cross-platform compilation and the benefits of compiled executables.

## 📦 Why Build Go Files?

Building (compiling) Go files converts your `.go` source code into a **standalone executable binary**. This process offers several advantages:

### ✅ Benefits of Building Go Programs

- **🚀 Performance**: Go compiles to native machine code — resulting in fast execution.
- **🧱 Portability**: Go creates statically linked binaries (no dependencies needed).
- **📤 Easy Distribution**: Build once, ship the binary — no need for users to install Go.
- **🔄 Cross-Compilation**: Build for any OS/architecture from any platform.
- **🔐 Security**: Closed-source delivery possible without sharing `.go` source.
- **🔍 Simplicity**: No need for JARs, virtual machines, or runtimes.

## 🔨 Basic Build (Current Platform)

```bash
go build main.go
````

* **Windows Output:** `main.exe`
* **Linux/macOS Output:** `main`

---

## 🏷️ Custom Output File Name

```bash
go build -o myapp main.go
```

---

## 🌍 Cross-Compilation with Go

Cross-compiling is easy using environment variables:

```bash
GOOS=<target-os> GOARCH=<target-arch> go build -o <output-name> main.go
```

---

### 🍏 macOS (Intel)

```bash
GOOS=darwin GOARCH=amd64 go build -o mymacapp main.go
```

---

### 🍎 macOS (Apple Silicon)

```bash
GOOS=darwin GOARCH=arm64 go build -o mymacarm main.go
```

---

### 🪟 Windows (64-bit)

```bash
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o myapp.exe main.go
```

---

### 🐧 Linux (64-bit)

```bash
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o mylinuxapp main.go
```

---

## 🔍 Common GOOS / GOARCH Combinations

| OS (`GOOS`) | Architecture (`GOARCH`) | Description                 |
| ----------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `windows`   | `amd64`, `386`          | Windows 64-bit / 32-bit     |
| `darwin`    | `amd64`, `arm64`        | macOS Intel / Apple Silicon |
| `linux`     | `amd64`, `386`, `arm64` | Linux (most distros)        |

---

## 🛠️ Build for All Platforms (Manually)

```bash
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o app.exe main.go
GOOS=darwin  GOARCH=amd64 go build -o app-macos main.go
GOOS=linux   GOARCH=amd64 go build -o app-linux main.go
```

---

## 📁 Notes

* Use `chmod +x <file>` on macOS/Linux to make binaries executable.
* You do not need to install Go on the target machine.
* For universal (fat) binaries on macOS, separate builds must be merged with tools like `lipo`.

Let me know if you want to automate builds using Makefiles or write deployment scripts.
